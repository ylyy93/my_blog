## L1: Introduction to Six Principles of Experimental Design

### Summary
1. Principle of Comparative Experimentation
2. “Fundamental Principle” of Statistical Inference
3. Principle of Experimental Manipulation
4. Principle of Blocking
5. Principle of Factorial Experimentation
6. Principle of Randomization

### Principle of Comparative Experimentation
> Differences between responses to treatments will be less affected by uncontrolled influences than individual responses to treatments.

You need a control treatment in your experiment!

### “Fundamental Principle” of Statistical Inference
> You make inference to the population from which you sample.

### Principle of Experimental Manipulation

##### Designed Experiments:
Studies in which the experimenter **manipulates** the experimental conditions or “treatments” experienced by the experimental units using a randomization scheme. (Sometimes called “Scientific Studies” or “Experimental Studies”).

##### Observational Studies:
Studies in which the experimenter **observes or measures**, but doesn’t manipulate the conditions experienced by the experimental units and does not have control over which experimental units receive which treatment or condition.
