Table:a

|HR_ID|Name|Hire_Date|Title|
|---|---|---|---|

Table:b

|HR_ID|Promotion_Date|Title|
|---|---|---|
|1111|04/01/2019|Sr.Analyst|


1. 从没升职的员工？

Method 1:

```
SELECT *
FROM a
WHERE a.HR_ID NOT IN
  (SELECT DISTINCT HR_ID
   FROM b)
```

Method 2:

```
SELECT a.*
FROM a
LEFT JOIN b
ON a.HR_ID = b.HR_ID
WHERE b.HR_ID IS NULL
```

1.1 所有升职过的员工？

```
SELECT DISTINCT a.*
FROM a
LEFT JOIN b
ON a.HR_ID = b.HR_ID
WHERE b.HR_ID IS NOT NULL
```

Table:a

|HR_ID|Name|Hire_Date|Title|
|---|---|---|---|
|1111|Jia|04/01/2018|Analyst|

Table:b

|Promotion_ID|HR_ID|Promotion_Date|Title|
|---|---|---|---|
|100|1111|04/01/2019|Sr.Analyst|

2.哪个员工升职最多？

```
SELECT b.HR_ID, count(DISTINCT Promotion_ID) as prom_count
FROM b
GROUP BY HR_ID
ORDER BY prom_count DESC
LIMIT 1
```

3.哪个员工升职次数第五多？

**Method 1: RANK FUNCTION**
```
SELECT DISTINCT c.HR_ID, c.prom_count,
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY c.prom_count DESC) as rnk
FROM
  (SELECT b.HR_ID, count(DISTINCT Promotion_ID) as prom_count
  FROM b
  GROUP BY HR_ID
  ORDER BY prom_count DESC) as c
QUALIFY rnk=5
```

**Method 2: SELF JOIN**

```
SELECT c1.HR_ID, COUNT(DISTINCT c2.prom_count) as RNK
FROM c c1
LEFT JOIN c c2
ON c1.prom_count <= c2.prom_count
GROUP BY 1
HAVING RNK = 5
```
