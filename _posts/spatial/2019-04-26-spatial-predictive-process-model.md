- Idea: (Low Rank) project process realizations of the former to a lower dimensional subspace.
- Flexible: non-stationary, non-Gaussian, multivariate, spatiotemporal
- Size: 3000 (anisotropic Matern, irregular, 1000*1000 domain), 15000 (non stationary)


## The Predictive Process Model

Knots:

$$
S^* = \{s_1^*,\ldots,s_m^*\}
$$

可以是观测值的子集或者不是。
